# Types of Data Structures

## Main Types

- Ordered/indexed
- Duplicates allowed
### Set
- Unordered/unindexed
- Elements immutable?
- 
### Dictionary

### Tuple
- Ordered/indexed
- Duplicates allowed
- Sets of elements immutable

# Types of Languages

## Compile Type
- Converted directly into machine code on build 
- Processor runs machine code as a whole
- e.g., recipe in greek, translated to english before cooking
- Adv:
  - Faster
## Interpreted Type
- Slower (improved by JIT compilation)
- Converted into machine code line by line  
- e.g., recipe in greek, greek friend instructs you step by step in english
- Adv:
  - Slower

## Statements vs Expressions
- Statements do something (e.g., `if, for, while, x=1, y=x+1, return`), they are complete units of execution. 
- Expressions evaluate TO a value (e.g., `x + 2, y`)


## Static Member/Method
- Belongs to class
- Uses less memory
- Compile time binding
## Non-static Member/Method
- Belongs to instance of class
- Uses more memory
- Runtime binding
