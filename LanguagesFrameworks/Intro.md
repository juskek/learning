# Types of Languages

## Compile Type
- Converted directly into machine code on build 
- Processor runs machine code as a whole
- e.g., recipe in greek, translated to english before cooking
- Adv:
  - Faster
## Interpreted Type
- Slower (improved by JIT compilation)
- Converted into machine code line by line  
- e.g., recipe in greek, greek friend instructs you step by step in english
- Adv:
  - Slower

## Statements vs Expressions
- Statements do something (e.g., `if, for, while, x=1, y=x+1, return`)
- Expressions evaluate TO a value (e.g., `x + 2, y`)
