- Graph like database with
  - entities
  - relationships
  - attributes
- Features
  - Expressivity
    - Entity-Relationship Model
      - Entities are things of interest
      - Relationships are defined between them
    - Type Hierarchy (OOP)
      - Inheritance
      - Polymorphism
    - N-ary Relations
      - More than one relationship between entities 
    - Nested Relations
      - e.g. marriage between 2 people entities is located in a city entity
  - Safety
    - Logical Data Validation
      - Checks entities and relations by evaluatin polymorphic types
    - Logical Query Validation
      - Static type checking during query compilation
  - Rule Definitions
    - Define rules to infer behaviours
  - Logical Inference
      - Queries are translated into all possible interpretations via
        - Type Based Inference
          - Checks relationships between types
        - Rule Based Inference
          - Checks rules for relationships
