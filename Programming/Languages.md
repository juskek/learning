# 1. Types of Languages

## 1.1. Design Approach (How is the program designed?)
### 1.1.1. Procedural
- Execute line by line
### 1.1.2. Functional
- Functions encapsulate instructions
- Contains procedural design
### 1.1.3. OOP
- Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance/Delegation, Polymorphism
- Contains procedural and functional design too

## 1.2. Time of Conversion (When is it converted?)
### 1.2.1. Compile Type
- Converted directly into machine code on build 
- Processor runs machine code as a whole
- e.g., recipe in greek, translated to english before cooking
- Adv:
  - Faster
### 1.2.2. Interpreted Type
- Slower (improved by JIT compilation)
- Converted into machine code line by line  
- e.g., recipe in greek, greek friend instructs you step by step in english
- Adv:
  - Slower

## 1.3. Instruction Approach (How is the compiler instructed?)
- Can have both types
### 1.3.1. Imperative
- Instruct compiler step by step
- e.g., getting odd numbers in C#
  ```
  List<int> numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
  
  List<int> results = new List<int>();
  foreach(var num in numbers)
  {
      if (num % 2 != 0)
            results.Add(num);
  }
  ```
  - Instruction:
    1. Create result collection 
    2. Step through each num in numbers
    3. If odd, add to result

### 1.3.2. Declarative
- Instruct compiler of final output
- e.g., getting odd numbers in LINQ
  ```
  List<int> numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
  
  var results = collection.Where( num => num % 2 != 0);
  ```
  - Instruction: Create result collection containing all numbers which are odd

## 1.4. Type Checking (When are data types checked?)
### 1.4.1. Static
- Compile time checking
### 1.4.2. Dynamic
- Runtime checking
## 1.5. Memory Management

### 1.5.1. Manual
- Explicit allocation and freeing of memory
- e.g,, C malloc, free
### 1.5.2. Automatic Memory Management
- Allocation and freeing of memory for automatic variables
  - Non-static local variables of a subroutine (function)
  - 
### 1.5.3. Automatic Garbage Collection (GC)
- Automatic freeing of memory allocated to objects that are no longer usable at 
  - Specified intervals
  - Low memory
- Advantages:
  - Handles retain cycles
- Disadvantages:
  - Synchronous: can compete for processor time
    - GC traverses all object references and marks live objects/roots
    - GC deallocates dead objects
  - Requires memory resources 
    - Sometimes five times more memory as opposed to manual
    - e.g., If your program needs 100 MB of RAM for its own objects, GC will require you to allocate 200â€“300 MB of space for optimal performance
### 1.5.4. Deterministic
- Always produces same result given a set of initial conditions
### 1.5.5. Automatic Reference Counting
- Deallocation of objects when the number of references to them reaches zero
- Advantages:
  - Asynchronous: relies on reference count
- Disadvantages:
  - Retain cycle memory leak
    - 2 dead objects referencing each other
    - Prevention: Explicit memory management with Storage Modifiers
Language Compilation Process
1. Translation: Translate compiled language to assembly language
2. Assemble: Convert assembly language to machine code
