# Email Memo 
Dear ____,

As requested, I have reviewed the security level of passwords from the leaked database and have arrived at the following findings:
- Hashing Algorithm: MD5
- Cracked Passwords: 19/19
- 

# What type of hashing algorithm was used to protect passwords?
Each of the hashes are 32 characters, which leads me to suspect that the hashing algorithm is the commonly used MD5, since it is a 128-bit hash function which produces 32 hexadecimal digits. However, other algorithms which produce 32 digit hashes include MD2, MD4, haval

It should be noted that a 32 character hash does not indicate the use of the aforementioned algorithms, since the hash 
-  could be produced by a longer encryption algorithm but stored in a 32-character field, or 
-  could be produced by concatenating two or more shorter hashing functions.

To determine whether an MD5 algorithm was used, HashCat was used to brute force commonly used passwords against the provided hashes. The following attacks were used to crack

Stage 1
- Hash: MD5
- Attack: Dictionary
  - Dictionary used was a wordlist of over 14 million passwords from the RockYou exposure in 2009
- Cracked: 13/19

```
- Remarks:
  - This confirms that the hashing algorithm used was MD5. A majority of the passwords were captured
Stage 2
- Hash: MD5
- Attack: 

# What level of protection does the mechanism offer for passwords?
# What controls could be implemented to make cracking much harder for the hacker in the event of a password database leaking again?
# What can you tell about the organizationâ€™s password policy (e.g. password length, key space, etc.)?
# What would you change in the password policy to make breaking the passwords harder?
